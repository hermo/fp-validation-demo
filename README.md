# Functional validation using Ramda
This is a small demo of functional validators presented at a company internal
tech demo.

The demo was inspired by a "two-track" concept found in a presentation
["Functional Programming Patterns"](http://www.slideshare.net/ScottWlaschin/fp-patterns-buildstufflt)
by Scott Wlaschin.
